# CMSC-27200-Theory-of-Algorithms
This course covers design and analysis of efficient algorithms, with emphasis on ideas rather than on implementation. Algorithmic questions include sorting and searching, graph algorithms, elementary algorithmic number theory, combinatorial optimization, randomized algorithms, as well as techniques to deal with intractability, like approximation algorithms. Design techniques include "divide-and-conquer" methods, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph search, as well as the design of efficient data structures. Methods of algorithm analysis include asymptotic notation, evaluation of recurrent inequalities, amortized analysis, analysis of probabilistic algorithms, the concepts of polynomial-time algorithms, and of NP-completeness.
